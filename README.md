# Graph Project
This project is based on one that I had to do for a programming course in
school.
I never managed to complete the project during the actual course, so I'm
reattempting it now because I want to prove to myself that I can finish it.

The goal of the project is to construct a weighted graph out of Wikipedia pages,
with edges being drawn based on which articles have hyperlinks to which others,
and weights being determined by comparing the frequency of words in each
article.
(Despite being based on hyperlinks, the graph is allowed to be undirected.)
Once a graph is counstructed, the program should be able to find a path between
two arbitrary nodes.
